2017 Room Persistence Library Tutorial by Ryan Kay.

**Please Note**
My intention is never to mislead anyone. If something in this tutorial strikes you as inaccurate or simply wrong, please create an issue in this repo. 

**Project Overview**

This project aims to demonstrate the usage of Android Architecture Component's Room Persistence Library; announced at Google I/O 2017. 

Room is an annotation based SQL Database Library. It allows you to fairly easily:
- create a working SQL Database
- create "Entities", or Data Models, which help you convert convert between SQL Data to Java Objects
- interact with the Database via Annotations like @Query().

There's plenty of other features, but in a nutshell, it's basically a way to build and interact with an SQL Database in an easier way than older framework tools. Suffice it to say that one had to write a lot of Boilerplate code, navigate some fairly obscure documentation, and Open/Close many a Cursor and Database Connection carefully.   

I'm happy to say that my experience with Room has been far different. The documentation, I/O Talks, and especially the Codelabs (links down below) do a really good job explaining the API.

## About Me
I'm an Android Dev living in Victoria BC Canada. I'm a major Nerd, and rambling about Software is quite therapeutic for me, to the extent that I have a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gosuddr93) mostly dedicated to that. I also do a Weekly Live Android Developer Q&A Series most Sundays at 8:00AM PDT (GMT -7). You can watch that at the aforementioned time [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/wiseAss/live).

**Please Read**
I don't release this stuff for free because I don't like money. Actually, I could use all the help I can get to improve my Equipment, Production Quality, Content, and pay my living expenses. If my content is worth even the average fancy Hipster Coffee to you, then please Consider sending me a Fiver once on Patreon.
